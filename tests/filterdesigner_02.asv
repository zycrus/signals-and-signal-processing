% Butterworth Bandpass filter designed using FDESIGN.BANDPASS.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 44100;  % Sampling Frequency

N   = 8;    % Order
Fc1 = 50;   % First Cutoff Frequency
Fc2 = 500;  % Second Cutoff Frequency

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its BUTTER method

[b a] = cheby2(N/4, )

[H, F] = freqz(b, a, 1024, Fs);
plot(F, abs(H));
